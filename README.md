 IPL 2024 Analysis Project | Excel Dashboard üìä

Thrilled to share my latest data analysis project where I delved into IPL 2024 data using Excel to uncover performance insights and trends across teams and players. This project was a great opportunity to enhance my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and decision-making.

üîç Project Overview:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Started by cleaning raw IPL data, removing inconsistencies, and organizing key variables such as match results, player stats, and team performance.
Performance Trends: Analyzed batting and bowling statistics, win-loss records, and match outcomes to spot trends in player performance and team success.
Excel Functions: Used pivot tables, advanced Excel functions (VLOOKUP, IF statements), and data filtering to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.
Visualization: Created interactive charts to visualize key metrics like top run scorers, strike rates, highest wicket-takers, and winning percentages of teams.
üí° Key Insights:

Top Performers: Players with higher strike rates and consistent boundary hitting were the leading contributors to their team‚Äôs success.
Match Outcomes: Teams with strong all-rounders saw more victories, especially in close matches.
Home vs Away: Teams performed better at home grounds, but a few stood out with exceptional away game performances, highlighting the importance of adaptability.
üìä Conclusion: This project gave me a comprehensive understanding of how data can be used to analyze player and team performance in sports like cricket. By leveraging Excel's capabilities, I was able to visualize critical trends that could inform strategies for future IPL seasons, helping teams maximize their performance.

This project enhanced my skills in data analysis, Excel, and storytelling through data. Looking forward to applying these insights and learnings in my future projects.
